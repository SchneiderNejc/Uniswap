Uniswap V2

# Swap
The UniswapV2SwapExamples contract demonstrates how to interact with the Uniswap V2 Router to perform token swaps. It supports both single-hop and multi-hop swaps using "exact input" and "exact output" methods.

Functions:
swapSingleHopExactAmountIn

Swaps an exact amount of WETH for a specified minimum amount of DAI.
Returns: The amount of DAI received.
swapMultiHopExactAmountIn

Swaps an exact amount of DAI for a specified minimum amount of USDC.
WETH is used as an intermediary (DAI → WETH → USDC).
Returns: The amount of USDC (target token) received.
swapSingleHopExactAmountOut

Swaps up to a maximum amount of WETH for an exact amount of DAI.
Excess WETH is refunded.
Returns: The amount of DAI received.
swapMultiHopExactAmountOut

Swaps up to a maximum amount of DAI for an exact amount of USDC.
WETH is used as an intermediary (DAI → WETH → USDC). Excess DAI is refunded.
Returns: The amount of USDC received.
Uniswap V2 Router Functions Utilized:
swapExactTokensForTokens

Swaps an exact input token amount for as many output tokens as possible (based on slippage and liquidity).
swapTokensForExactTokens

Swaps as few input tokens as necessary to receive an exact output token amount.


# Uniswap V2 Add/Remove Liquidity

The UniswapV2AddLiquidity contract provides methods to interact with the Uniswap V2 Router for adding and removing liquidity in token pairs.

Functions:
addLiquidity

Adds liquidity to a Uniswap V2 pool for a specified token pair.
Steps:
Transfers _amountA and _amountB of _tokenA and _tokenB from the sender to the contract.
Approves the Uniswap V2 Router to spend the tokens.
Calls the router's addLiquidity function to deposit the tokens into the liquidity pool.
Returns:
amountA and amountB: Actual amounts of tokens deposited.
liquidity: Amount of liquidity tokens minted.
removeLiquidity

Removes liquidity from a Uniswap V2 pool for a specified token pair.
Steps:
Fetches the liquidity pair's address using the Uniswap V2 Factory.
Transfers the contract's liquidity tokens to the router.
Calls the router's removeLiquidity function to withdraw the tokens from the pool.
Returns:
amountA and amountB: Amounts of tokens withdrawn.

# Optimal One-Sided Supply
Optimal one-sided supply is a strategy used in decentralized finance (DeFi) for efficiently adding liquidity to a token pair pool (like Uniswap) when you hold only one of the tokens in the pair. Instead of requiring both tokens in equal proportions, this method determines how much of the held token should be swapped for the other token to minimize slippage and maximize liquidity provision efficiency.

Key Concepts:
Why It's Needed:
Liquidity pools require a balanced ratio of two tokens (e.g., Token A and Token B). If you only hold Token A, simply swapping an arbitrary amount into Token B can lead to poor execution due to price impact (slippage) or inefficient use of your assets. Optimal one-sided supply solves this.

How It Works:

It uses a mathematical formula to calculate the exact amount of the held token to swap for the paired token. This ensures the least price impact and creates the most balanced liquidity addition.
After the swap, both tokens are added to the pool in proportion to the pool's current reserves.
Benefits:

Efficiency: Maximizes the use of your tokens, ensuring you're not adding liquidity unevenly.
Minimized Slippage: Reduces the price impact caused by large swaps in the pool.
Convenience: Automates the process of swapping and adding liquidity, requiring only a single token from the user.
Use Cases:

Users or protocols that hold only one token but want to provide liquidity to a specific pool.
Strategies for liquidity mining where one-sided input is preferred.

Functions:
getSwapAmount
Calculates the optimal amount of a token to swap for the other token in the pair based on the reserves and the input amount.
Returns: Optimal swap amount.

zap
Automates the one-sided liquidity supply process:

Swaps the optimal amount of _tokenA for _tokenB.
Adds both tokens as liquidity to the pool.

_swap (Internal)
Executes a token swap via Uniswap V2 Router

_addLiquidity (Internal)
Adds liquidity to the Uniswap V2 pool using the tokens available in the contract.

# Flash swaps
A flash swap is a feature of Uniswap V2 that allows you to borrow tokens from a liquidity pool without providing upfront collateral, provided you repay the borrowed amount plus a small fee within the same transaction. This atomicity ensures that either all steps of the operation are completed successfully, or the transaction is reverted.
This feature is useful for arbitrage, collateral swaps, or other advanced DeFi strategies.

How It Works:

A user initiates a swap function with parameters specifying the desired token and amount.
Uniswap provides the requested tokens but expects the repayment (plus a 0.3% fee) within the same transaction.
If the repayment conditions aren't met, the transaction reverts, ensuring liquidity providers face no risk.

Why It's Needed:
Flash swaps are useful when users need temporary access to liquidity for advanced DeFi strategies without holding the upfront capital for the required tokens.

Functions
flashSwap

Triggers the flash swap by specifying the amount of WETH to borrow.
Encodes data for the uniswapV2Call callback function.
uniswapV2Call

Automatically called by the Uniswap V2 pair contract after tokens are transferred.
Processes custom logic (e.g., arbitrage) and ensures repayment of the borrowed amount plus fees.
Implements a 0.3% fee calculation on the borrowed amount and transfers the fee from the user.
swap (in IUniswapV2Pair)

Facilitates the actual transfer of tokens to the borrower and invokes the uniswapV2Call callback.

Use Cases:
Arbitrage: Profit from price discrepancies across platforms or tokens.
Collateral Swapping: Replace collateral in lending protocols with a different token.
Flash Loans Replacement: Serve as an alternative to traditional flash loans for certain operations.
the 0.3% fee is the standard fee charged by Uniswap V2

Uniswap V3

# Swap

Key Differences Between Uniswap V2 and V3 Swaps:
Routing & Pools:

V2: Single pool, fixed fee (0.3%), constant product formula.
V3: Supports multiple fee tiers, concentrated liquidity, and multi-hop routing.
Swap Flexibility:

V2: Fixed input-output swaps, simpler logic.
V3: Offers exact input/output swaps and advanced controls like price limits (sqrtPriceLimitX96).
Liquidity & Fees:

V2: Uniform liquidity distribution, fixed fees.
V3: LPs provide liquidity in specific price ranges; multiple fee tiers per pool.
Gas & Efficiency:

V2: Lower gas due to simpler design.
V3: Higher gas costs but better price execution with routing.
Contracts:

V2: Basic single-pair swaps.
V3: Handles complex multi-hop paths and fee customization via SwapRouter02.
In short, V3 is more flexible and efficient but more complex than V2.

# Liquidity V3

Differences:
Concentrated Liquidity:

V3 uses price ranges (tickLower and tickUpper) to provide concentrated liquidity within a specific range, maximizing efficiency.
V2 provides liquidity uniformly across the entire price range.
Minting NFT Positions:

In V3, a liquidity position is represented as a non-fungible token (NFT) with unique metadata tied to the position (price range, fees, etc.).
V2 uses fungible LP tokens to represent liquidity positions.
Fee Management:

V3 allows fee collection per position via the collectAllFees function. Fees accumulate for each NFT position.
V2 automatically distributes fees to LP tokens without requiring manual collection.
Granular Liquidity Management:

V3 allows increase and decrease of liquidity within existing positions without affecting others.
V2 requires adding or removing liquidity across the entire pool.

Summary:
Uniswap V3 enhances flexibility and efficiency by introducing concentrated liquidity, NFT-based positions, and granular control. V2, on the other hand, offers a simpler, uniform liquidity provision mechanism.

# Flash loan

Flash loan vs Flash swap:
Flash Loans: Borrow tokens without upfront collateral, repay within the same transaction with fees. No specific trading pair required.

Flash Swaps: Borrow one token from a Uniswap pool, repay with the other token (or equivalent value) in the same transaction. Requires a specific trading pair.

Flash loans distinct use cases
Flash loans enable use cases where flash swaps are insufficient, including:

Arbitrage Across Multiple Pools: Execute arbitrage across pools or platforms not directly connected via a Uniswap pair.
Collateral Swaps: Repay and re-collateralize loans across lending protocols like Aave or Compound in one transaction.
Debt Refinancing: Move or restructure debt between protocols efficiently.
Complex Transactions: Combine multiple DeFi actions (e.g., arbitrage + collateral swap) that require liquidity without relying on a single trading pair.
Protocol Upgrades: Liquidate and reinvest funds during governance or strategy changes.
Flash swaps are limited to Uniswap pool pairs, while flash loans provide greater flexibility.

Shared use cases 
Arbitrage: Both can be used to exploit price differences between trading pairs or platforms.
Liquidity Provision: Temporarily provide liquidity for swaps or transactions that require large token amounts.
Liquidation: Cover loan positions on lending platforms to avoid liquidation, though flash loans are more versatile for multi-protocol scenarios.

Functions:
flash
Initiates a flash loan for specified token amounts.

uniswapV3FlashCallback
Handles loan repayment and associated fees.

# Flash Swap Arbitrage

Flash Swap Arbitrage vs. Regular Flash Swap
1. Objective:

Flash Swap Arbitrage: Specifically designed to exploit price differences between two pools for profit.
Regular Flash Swap: General-purpose borrowing of tokens from a pool without requiring upfront capital
2. Workflow Complexity:

Flash Swap Arbitrage: Involves multiple steps:
Flash borrow tokens from Pool A.
Trade borrowed tokens on Pool B.
Repay Pool A and keep the profit.
Regular Flash Swap: Usually ends with the repayment of the borrowed tokens and any associated fees, without further trading.
3. Key Focus:

Flash Swap Arbitrage: Profit generation by exploiting market inefficiencies.
Regular Flash Swap: Fulfills temporary liquidity needs for a variety of use cases.
4. Profit Validation:

Flash Swap Arbitrage: Includes logic to ensure profitability before proceeding.
Regular Flash Swap: Focuses on completing a predefined action, with no inherent profit-checking mechanism.
5. Example Use Cases:

Flash Swap Arbitrage: Arbitrage between Uniswap pools with differing fees (e.g., 0.3% vs. 0.05%).
Regular Flash Swap: Collateral swaps, debt refinancing, or liquidity testing.
In summary, flash swap arbitrage is a specialized application of flash swaps aimed at profiting from price disparities, while regular flash swaps serve broader financial use cases without the specific focus on arbitrage.

Functions:
flashSwap
Performs a flash swap to borrow tokens from a Uniswap V3 pool.

_swap
